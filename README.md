# 🏄‍♂️ Forrest Knight

**`Digital Craftsman (Developer/Filmmaker/Creator)`**

I'm an indie full-stack developer and content creator building my version of the digital world one step at a time. All coding projects are built from the ground up, from planning and designing all the way to solving real-life problems with code. All video content is built the same way, from ideation and planning, all the way to finalizing the content with artistic touches. I publish that content on my YouTube channel "[ForrestKnight][youtube]" to more than 400k subscribers.
